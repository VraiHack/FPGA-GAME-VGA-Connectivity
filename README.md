# FPGA Spartan 3A (Shooting Game)

The main idea from this project, is for helping beginner peoples in the FPGA world to learn how to make your first game on FPGA. So letâ€™s we start:

 - First we need to buy the ELBERT V2 board:

 - Second we need to install on our PC the USB driver for the FPGA:

 - Third we need to install the Xilinx program which in my case (Xilinx\14.7 ISE design Suite):

 - Then, we need to install the ElbertV2Config.exe:

 - I recommended you to get more information about the Elbert V2 board and about the ISE  design suite to initialize your first project directory.

**A- VGA functionality:**

![Second image it will show you how Horizontal and vertical syncronization work, and how i can use it to draw an image in the 
VGA_sync module.](https://github.com/hassan-salloum/FPGA_VGA/blob/master/Documentation/HVSYNC.png)


**B- The main code:**

Code have for initial module:

        Topmodule: responsible of the declaration of the VGA system (input and output).
        U1 - IN_CLOCK_OUT: Take a 12 MHz from the Topmodule and generate a 25 MHz clock as output.
        U2 - counter: this counter use 25 MHz as input clock and his output it will be used for the synchronization time of VGA_sync and Topmodule modules.  
        U3 - VGA_sync: this module responsible of the vertical and horizontal synchronization and for the video output.
